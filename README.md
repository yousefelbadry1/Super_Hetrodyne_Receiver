## Description <a name = "Description"></a>
This endeavor focused on designing and simulating a **super-heterodyne receiver** and AM modulator using MATLAB. 

Highlights of the Project: 

1️⃣ Comprehensive Audio Signal Processing: 
 - Loading and resampling audio signals for consistent processing. 
 - Transitioning from stereo to mono for simplified modulation. 

2️⃣ Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM): 
 - Designed tunable **band-pass filters** and mixers to handle multiple signals efficiently. 
 - Implemented **DSB-SC modulation** to ensure spectrum efficiency. 

3️⃣ Noise Analysis & Signal Recovery: 
 - Explored the effects of SNR on audio quality. 
 - Developed strategies to mitigate signal degradation. 

4️⃣ Tunable Filtering & IF Stage: 
 - Designed dynamic filters to isolate and recover the desired signals, ensuring minimal distortion and optimal clarity. 

5️⃣ Real-Time Testing: 
 - Successfully demodulated signals and validated performance with audio playback.
